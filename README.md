Develop an Excel dashboard that enables store management to:
●	Monitor inventory levels.
●	Track missing items based on date, time of day, and responsible staff members.
●	Present data visually for quick insights and informed decision-making.
Requirements
1.	Total Missing Items per Day:
2.	Missing Items by Time of Day:
3.	Missing Items by Staff:
4.	Item-Level Analysis:
○	Calculate the total quantity of each missing item.
○	Identify the top two items with the highest missing quantities.
Dashboard Elements
●	KPIs Summary Section: Display the following key performance indicators (KPIs):
○	Total Missing Items: The total sum of all missing quantities in the dataset.
○	Highest Missing Quantity per Day: Identify the day with the most missing items.
○	Top Missing Item: The item with the highest overall missing quantity.
○	Staff Member with Most Missing Items: The staff member accountable for the highest number of missing items.
○	Top 2 Items & Shifts with Missing Quantities:

■	Identify the time shifts (Morning, Afternoon, Evening) that have the highest missing quantities.
○	Missing Patterns by Day of the Week: Visual representation of missing items by weekday for trend analysis.
Interactive Filtering & Slicers
●	Slicers: Incorporate slicers for dynamic filtering of data by:
○	Date
○	Time of Day
○	Responsible Staff
○	Item Category (if provided in the dataset)
●	Dynamic Filtering: Ensure the dashboard updates in real time when any slicer is applied, enabling focused analysis.
Data Visualization
●	Trends in Missing Items
●	Missing Items by Time of Day

●	Top Missing Items
Expected Deliverables
●	An Excel file containing the completed dashboard and associated data.
●	A summary report (included on a separate worksheet or as comments on the dashboard) detailing key findings and recommendations.
